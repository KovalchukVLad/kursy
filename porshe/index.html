                <h2>Porshe 911 1963-1973</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/63-73.jpg" alt="63-73">
                <p>The 901 concept of 1963 heralded the start of a production run even Porsche probably didn’t expect to
                    reach – and no doubt surpass – six decades. Trivia fans can rejoice at the fact the name changed
                    form 901 to 911 to avoid potential fisticuffs with Peugeot.
                    It was designed as a larger, more practical version of the 356 with an extra pair of seats. As such,
                    critics were quick to pounce on its lack of focus.
                    Early 911s used two-litre engines with as little as 130bhp, though they also weighed bang on a
                    tonne. Both engine sizes and power outputs swelled over the next decade, culminating in perhaps the
                    most coveted of all early 911s, the 210bhp 2.7 Carrera RS.</p>

                <h2>Porshe 911 1973-1989</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/73-89.jpg" alt="73-89">
                <p>Each new iteration of 911 was internally codenamed with a letter of the alphabet, but it wasn’t until
                    reaching G that there was a discernable difference in styling and tech, and the dawn of a new
                    generation.
                    The G-Series ran for a long time, too, debuting in 1973 and only being replaced in 1989. The most
                    significant move made in this time was the introduction of turbocharging to the 911, the Turbo you
                    see above arriving in 1975 with a mighty 260bhp powering the rear wheels. Back then, though,
                    turbochargers were saved for only the fastest 911s…</p>

                <p>The 964, to give it its internal codename, arrived at the very end of the 1980s, bringing with it
                    some mildly updated styling but a whole heap of new tech.
                    In fact, it was 85 per cent new. Four-wheel drive arrived for the first time, as did other tech
                    goodies like power steering, ABS brakes and airbags.
                    Until recently, second-hand examples of these could be picked up exceedingly cheap, its design
                    viewed retrospectively as the least attractive in 911 history. Many are now becoming donor cars for
                    Singer products, though, while the stripped-out 964 RS is spiralling in value in recognition of it
                    being one of the focused 911 products ever.</p>

                <img class="imag" src="images/89094.jpg" alt="94-98">
                <p>We’re going to stick with Porsche’s internal model codes, both to avoid confusion and because they’re
                    reasonably well known among car nerds. The 993 arrived just five years after the 964, and is still
                    regarded by many Porsche die-hards as the prettiest and best-judged of the lot.
                    It was the last 911 with an air-cooled engine, while it also introduced perhaps the lairiest car in
                    911 history to drive, the GT2. It’s a badge that’s continued service since, of course, but the
                    original perhaps best displayed those tail-happy tendencies brought about by the 911’s infamously
                    unconventional rear-engine layout. Small wonder it earned itself the nickname ‘Widow Maker’.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box1"><h2>Porshe 911 1998-2001</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/98-01.jpg" alt="98-01">
                <p>Following such a loved generation of car, the 1998 arrival of the water-cooled 996 was met with
                    grumbles and cries of ‘it’s lost its character’, something of a running theme for new-generation
                    911s and the implacable Porsche aficionados they’ve tried to please.
                    Those nonplussed by the change in hardware were probably upset by the looks, the 911 gaining its
                    first major styling change, not dissimilar to the cheaper Boxster and notable for its – shock
                    horror! – non-elliptical headlights.
                    The 996 also marked the exponential growth in 911 variants, but when that also goes hand-in-hand
                    with the first ever GT3 being launched, that’s far from bad news.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box1"><h2>Porshe 911 2001-2004</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/01-04.jpg" alt="01-04">
                <p>Water-cooled 911s also kicked off the habit of major mid-life updates. The 996 received its big
                    facelift in 2001, with attempts to appease critics of its styling, an updated interior and a new
                    glass-roofed Targa variant, though it was nothing like as stylish as its ancestors.

                    The mk2 996 also marked the arrival of another 911 GT2, and while it was a bit less hairy than its
                    Nineties namesake, it was still a 196mph, turbocharged 911 without the safety of a four-wheel-drive
                    system. Senior.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box1"><h2>Porshe 911 2004-2008</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/04-08.jpg" alt="04-08">
                <p>Round headlights made a swift return in 2004, with the arrival of an all-new 911 generation. Its
                    shape was broadly the same as the 996, but its detailing more delicate. All had more than 300bhp,
                    while a new GT2 entered unchartered territory with 530bhp.
                    Once again, though, claims of diminishing of character greeted the 997’s arrival, with purists
                    grumbling about less feelsome steering and the softening of the 911’s, um, exciting edges thanks to
                    stronger grip.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box1"><h2>Porshe 911 2008-2011</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/08-11.jpg" alt="08-11">
                <p>The looks barely changed, but there were bigger changes afoot underneath them for the updated 997.
                    More efficient direct injection engines marked the first nod to more environmentally caring 911s,
                    while the PDK twin-clutch gearbox arrived. Immediate response wasn’t rapturous, but after Porsche
                    fitted the double-clutcher with proper paddles, its appeal over the clunky old Tiptronic automatic
                    was clear.
                    The 911 reached its only recently unsurpassed power peak thanks to the utterly ludicrous 611bhp GT2
                    RS, while arguably the best ever 911 – the GT3 RS 4.0 – also landed in this generation, too. No
                    wonder its successor faced such a tough time…</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box1"><h2>Porshe 911 2011-2015</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/11-15.jpg" alt="11-15">
                <p>The 991 arrived in 2011, and while it may have been coined the prettiest 911 in decades, nothing
                    could save it from a wrath of criticism for its new electric steering.
                    Still, there’s been plenty to distract from that, with an amazingly new round-edged GT car character
                    in the regular Carrera models, and a new level of savagery with the bonkers GT3 RS. The Targa is
                    also cool again.
                    It will go down in history as the last of the 911s to have naturally aspirated Carreras that rev to
                    the heavens…</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box2"><h2>Porshe 911 2015-2018</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/15-18.jpg" alt="15-18">
                <p>…and that’s because of the 991’s big update, which saw 3-litre flat-six turbo engines in the Carrera
                    models, ensuring all but the GT3 and GT3 RS created their power with the help of forced induction.
                    It’s a move that initially upset the purists, but then so was electric steering, PDK, water-cooling,
                    and so much more. And the 991.2 enjoyed some rather big moments: the one millionth Porsche 911, the
                    arrival of the most powerful 911 yet, the 691bhp GT2 RS (and some ‘Ring records to go with it) and a
                    couple of new variants in the shape of the lovely Carrera T and the even lovelier 935 track special,
                    the 991.2’s swansong.</p>

            <div class="box2"><h2>Porshe 911 2018-now</h2>
                <img class="imag" src="images/18.jpg" alt="18-now">
                <p>See? It doesn’t look the same. The basic silhouette hasn’t changed but there’s a big styling leap in
                    the shape of the long light bar at the back and full track widths for all models, not just the
                    four-wheel-drive and motorsport cars.
                    For now, it’s relatively conventional, with the Carrera models carrying over the same 3-litre
                    flat-six turbo engines, albeit with lower emissions yet more power, in typically clever Porsche
                    fashion. But this could be the first generation of 911 that goes hybrid. Read more about it right
